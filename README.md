# 🛠️ BuildTools – Handy Building Tools GUI and More (Minecraft 1.21.4 – 1.21.8)

**BuildTools** currently starts with a convenient GUI that provides useful building tools such as the Debug Stick.  
Instead of manually giving yourself items, a simple command opens a menu with everything a builder needs.  

:point_right: This plugin will be **extended with more features** in future versions – not just the GUI.
